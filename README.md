# SportChek Custom CMS

Your team (2 members) will be given about 7 weeks to create a custom CMS to power a products/products details site for Sports Chek ( https://www.sportchek.ca/ ). Additional features such as filtering and search must be added to this site for ease-of-use.

## Description

1. The landing page should have at least 35 products listed.
2. Customers can search and filter by category among the 35 products without login.
3. Admins can log in through /admin page with right credentials.
4. After login, the dashboard page will have a navigation menu for admins about where to go.
5. Admins can create, update and delete products (pictures, text, and category) on the site after login.
6. *CSS styles are optional for the project.
